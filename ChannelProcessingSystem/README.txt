each capital letter value must produce an array and the low-case b must produce a metric number. For this I looked at the value of m and c I noticed that they are 1 decimal place, therefore, I assumed that b will be 1 decimal place. Then to make the program flexible and increase usability, I decided to store the results of the functions into text files and put functions in for the program to read from text files, then to assign the data from the text files to an array. I did this because if the user had a different set of values, they could insert them into the text files and produce new results. Planning for this was to understand arrays and to understand their functions, furthermore, I did research on functions. Lastly, I wanted to make the program function in a way where if the user knew the value of Y already, they would have to put the data into a text file with the name “ValueY.txt” and just not call Function 1. This is the same with Function 3 and 4, if the values are already known all the user must do is put the data into a text file ensuring that the program can locate the text file and from there the program will produce new results. Having the program set up like this makes the program flexible and usable even if some of the data is already present. Therefore, setting up functions was a great way to tackle this issue because the user can call which function, they want based on the data they have already. The missing point to complete this program is: Function to work out X, m and c. With this the program will be complete in all aspects.
